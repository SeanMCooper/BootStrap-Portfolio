          <p class="lead">Sean Cooper... Musician, seasoned kitchen veteran, elitist retro PC gamer, future programmer, current student, learner of all things challenging and time-consuming, just another victim to a capitalist society. Welcome, to the darkest corner of the internet, the end all be all of the digitial realm, the alpha, the omega, presumptiously the final resting place of all time, space and thought, my bio.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">I do not enjoy working with bootstrap, I have probably over thought or misinterpreted the assignment, but I definately think it is easier and more reliable to create pages from scratch. Perhaps, I could create my own default grid that I can utilize for ease of making pages in the future, but the seemingly un-ending lists of classes that I do not how to control or manipulate has made this a very frustrating project.
